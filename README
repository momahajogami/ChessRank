It's a shame the way that chess players
talk about their "ratings".

It seems undignified and sours the mood. 

But what can we do?  You need some sort of
system.  I suggest viewing any collection of
chess games as a graph with two arrows in the
same direction for a win and opposing arrows
for a draw.  Then, run Google's pagerank
algorithm on the graph and you have one
meaningful ranking of the players.

Let's imagine the rules of chess extended a bit
to include pageRank as part of the game.  What
would that look like?
