It's a shame the way that chess players
talk about their "ratings".

It seems undignified and sours the mood. 

But what can we do?  You need some sort of
system.  I suggest viewing any collection of
chess games as a graph with two arrows in the
same direction for a win and opposing arrows
for a draw.  Then, run Google's pagerank
algorithm on the graph and you have one
meaningful ranking of the players.

Let's imagine the rules of chess extended a bit
to include pageRank as part of the game.  What
would that look like?

My milkshake brings all the boys to
the yard
all of them
the ground begins to rumble and 3
billion boys pour in over the hills in
an huge boy tsunami, eclipsing the
sun, destroying everything in their
path.
the entire city is razed ot the
ground.  The screams of boys being
crushed to death among the fray
combines into a deafening roar of
suffering.
I stare at my milkshake with hollow,
haunted eyes.  What have I done.
