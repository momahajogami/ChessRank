This project combines two ideas which have
already been worked out as two seperate ideas
on github.

pageRank.py is a general tool for running
pageRank on graphs.  It's great!

I don't actually have a strong opinion on the
merits of this particular implementation the
the authors themselves are humble about.

But it's easy to use and it works so that's
great for me.

The other major component is pgn.py by Renato
de Pontes Pereira.  This is a simple tool for
parsing chess files (not to be confused with
png, the popular format for images).

For your tutorial, examine each of these files
and see that they work.

Now, see that this pgn.py is used by the new
program pgn2csv.  pgn2csv uses pgn to extract
just the results from the headers of the chess
games and export them to a graph in the csv
format that is expected by pageRank.py
